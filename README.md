# 🐛 Fall Armyworm Supervised AI Detection

**Capstone Project – AI Bootcamp 2025**

This project focuses on developing a **supervised machine learning model** for the detection and classification of the **Fall Armyworm (FAW)** (*Spodoptera frugiperda*) from visual data (images or videos).  
It applies core **supervised learning** techniques—classification and detection—to address a real-world agricultural problem threatening food security across Africa.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

The **Fall Armyworm** is a destructive pest responsible for over **31% annual maize loss in Africa**.  
Early and accurate detection of FAW larvae, pupae, or moths can significantly reduce crop damage.

This project aims to build a **compact, deployable, and performant AI model** capable of detecting FAW presence from visual inputs.  
The trained model will be exported to **ONNX format**, making it ready for real-world deployment on mobile or embedded systems.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Apply Supervised Learning:** Implement classification or regression using Python-based AI/ML libraries.  
- **Develop Computer Vision Skills:** Handle image data preprocessing, augmentation, and model training.  
- **Optimize Model Performance:** Select lightweight architectures suitable for limited compute environments (e.g., Google Colab).  
- **Enable Deployment Readiness:** Export trained models to **ONNX format** for cross-platform compatibility.  
- **Ensure Reproducibility:** Maintain clear documentation and well-structured code.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (Google Colab Only)

This section guides you through setting up and running the **Fall Armyworm Supervised AI Detection** project entirely in **Google Colaboratory (Colab)** — no local installation is required.

---

### 1. Open in Google Colab

1. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on **File → Open Notebook → GitHub**.
3. Paste the repository link (e.g., `https://github.com/mantle-bearer/FAW-Detection-Capstone`).
4. Open the notebook file (named `FAW_Detection.ipynb`).

Alternatively, you can open it directly by clicking the **“Open in Colab”** badge included in the github repository.

---

### 2. Mount Google Drive

Mount your Google Drive to access and save datasets, logs, and trained models.

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
Once mounted, ensure your working directory points to your project folder:
```python
%base_dir = "/content/drive/MyDrive/FAW_Dataset/"
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

Google Colab comes with many pre-installed libraries.
However, to ensure full compatibility, install any missing dependencies using:
```python
!pip install keras-tuner --upgrade

# Uninstall conflicting packages
!pip uninstall -y protobuf tf2onnx onnx

# Install compatible versions
!pip install protobuf==3.20.3
!pip install tf2onnx==1.15.1
!pip install onnx==1.13.1
```

---

### 4. Load the Dataset

The custom Fall Armyworm (FAW) dataset has been provided for training the model.
To load it into Colab:

Upload the final [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yP-eU-6Itm0Vb_wbMAcyJtpqPfkkQ3E5?usp=sharing) to your Google Drive (e.g., /MyDrive/FAW_Dataset/).

Extract the dataset:
1. Upload it to your Google Drive (e.g., /MyDrive/FAW_Dataset/).
2. Extract the dataset if:
   ```python
   import zipfile
   with zipfile.ZipFile('/content/drive/MyDrive/FAW_Dataset.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
   zip_ref.extractall('/content/drive/MyDrive/FAW_Dataset/')
   ```

3. Confirm dataset accessibility:
   ```python
   import os
   os.listdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/FAW_Dataset/')
   ```
---
   
### 5. Run the Notebook Cells Sequentially

Run each cell in order from top to bottom:

-   Data Loading
-   Preprocessing & Augmentation
-   Model Building & Training
-   Evaluation
-   Export to ONNX

Each step is clearly labeled within the Colab notebook.
Avoid skipping cells to maintain reproducibility.

---

### 6. Save Your Trained Model

Once training is complete, save your best-performing model to Drive:
```
# Save the fine-tuned model in Keras format
fine_tune_model.save(f"{best_model_name}_finetuned_final.keras")
```

Convert to ONNX format for deployment compatibility:
```python
# Define ONNX file name
onnx_model_path = f"{best_model_name}_finetuned_final.onnx"

# Convert TensorFlow/Keras model to ONNX
spec = (tf.TensorSpec((None, 224, 224, 3), tf.float32, name="input"),)
onnx_model, _ = tf2onnx.convert.from_keras(fine_tune_model, input_signature=spec, opset=13)

# Save the ONNX model
onnx.save(onnx_model, onnx_model_path)
```
---

### 7. Verify ONNX Model

To ensure your exported ONNX model works properly:
```python
onnx_model = onnx.load(onnx_model_path')
onnx.checker.check_model(onnx_model)
print("ONNX Model is valid and ready for deployment.")
```
---

### 8. Proceed to Evaluation and Documentation

After confirming successful training and export:

-   Record metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
-   Document data preprocessing, architecture choice, training process, and results directly within the Colab notebook (using Markdown cells).
-   Ensure all visuals (graphs, confusion matrices) are properly displayed.

---

> 💡 Tip: Always connect to a GPU runtime for faster training.
Go to Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU.

✅ You’re now ready to train, evaluate, and document your Fall Armyworm Detection Model entirely in Google Colab.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced and Future Work

This section highlights the key challenges encountered during the development of the **Fall Armyworm Supervised AI Detection Model** and outlines potential areas for improvement and future exploration.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced

1. **Limited and Imbalanced Dataset**
   - The available Fall Armyworm dataset had fewer samples for certain infestation stages (e.g., pupae or early larvae), which affected model balance.
   - Data augmentation techniques were used to increase diversity, but more real-world samples are needed to improve generalization.

2. **Compute Resource Constraints**
   - Running deep learning models in **Google Colab** occasionally led to runtime disconnections and limited GPU time.
   - This sometimes restricted the number of epochs or hyperparameter tuning sessions that could be performed.

3. **Model Overfitting**
   - Early versions of the model achieved high accuracy on the training set but performed poorly on validation data.
   - This was mitigated using dropout layers, early stopping, and regularization techniques.

4. **ONNX Export Compatibility**
   - Converting the TensorFlow/Keras model to **ONNX** format initially caused compatibility warnings due to unsupported layers.
   - Adjusting the model architecture and using the `tf2onnx` library resolved this issue.

5. **Image Quality Variations**
   - Field images of Fall Armyworm infestations varied significantly in lighting, background, and angle.
   - Preprocessing (resizing, normalization, contrast adjustment) helped reduce this effect.

---

### 🌱 Future Work

1. **Dataset Expansion and Refinement**
   - Collaborate with agricultural researchers to collect a larger, more balanced dataset with multiple infestation conditions.
   - Introduce more diverse data sources (e.g., drone or satellite images) for broader model adaptability.

2. **Advanced Model Architectures**
   - Explore lightweight but powerful architectures like **MobileNetV3**, **EfficientNet**, or **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for improved accuracy and efficiency.
   - Implement ensemble learning to combine predictions from multiple models.

3. **Model Deployment and Real-World Testing**
   - Integrate the exported ONNX model into a **mobile or web app** for real-time FAW detection.
   - Test the model in real farm environments using smartphone or drone imagery.

4. **Explainable AI (XAI) Integration**
   - Incorporate visualization techniques such as **Grad-CAM** or **LIME** to highlight which parts of the image influenced the model’s prediction.
   - This helps in building trust and interpretability among users and agricultural experts.

5. **Automation and Continuous Improvement**
   - Automate model retraining pipelines using new data collected from deployed systems.
   - Enable active learning where the model improves continuously from user feedback.

---

> 💡 **In summary:** While the current model successfully demonstrates Fall Armyworm detection using supervised learning in Colab, expanding the dataset, improving model robustness, and deploying the system in real agricultural contexts will make it even more impactful and production-ready.
